Title: Classification of millimeter sources in W51 Main / IRS2

Abstract: We cross-match several radio and millimeter source catalogs
in the W51 IRS2 and Main regions to obtain SEDs.  We classify the sources
as HII regions, dusty YSOs, or other.

Data:
Describe ALMA, VLA data sets

Methods:
Describe the dendrocat package.


Analysis:
-Flux-Flux plots & histograms of SED power-law slope parameter Alpha
 - classification of some sources as HII regions

-Comparison of flux recovery in Goddi+ 0.04" resolution data to Ginsburg+ 0.2"
resolution data.
Sources with high flux recovery (>80%?) are 'compact' and probably have no significant
envelope, while sources with low flux recovery (<20%?) may be "starless" cores.
Can compare this to Robitaille+ 2007 SED models.


Discussion:
What fraction of sources are YSOs, HII regions?  What fraction of sources would have been
misclassified using other (e.g., Ginsburg+ 2017) criteria?

What fraction of Ginsburg+ 2017 sources do not have high-resolution counterparts (in the overlap region)?

What fraction of Ginsburg+ 2017 sources have multiple associations?  Can
anything useful be said about these sources?

What fraction of high-resolution sources are not detected in Ginsburg+ 2017
because they are hidden by confusion?
